Domain Regulations and Http Status Code Compatibility

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a set of rules that allows web browsers to load web pages.
It works by sending requests from the browser to a server, which then sends a response back. 

An HTTP request consists of different parts:
- HTTP version: The version of HTTP being used.
- URL: The web address of the page or resource being requested.
- HTTP method: The action the request wants to perform, such as GET (to retrieve information) or POST (to submit information).
- Request headers: Information about the request, like the browser being used.
- Optional request body: Additional data, like form information, if needed.

An HTTP response is what the browser receives from the server. It includes:
- HTTP status code: A three-digit code that indicates if the request was successful or encountered an error.
- Response headers: Information about the response, such as the language or format of the data.
- Optional response body: The actual content of the response, usually the HTML data that makes up a webpage.

HTTP status codes are used to indicate the outcome of a request. Codes starting with '2' mean success, like '200 OK'.
Codes starting with '4' or '5' indicate errors, such as '404 NOT FOUND' (when a page is missing) or '500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR' (when something went wrong on the server).

HTTP headers are used in both requests and responses to provide additional information,
like the browser being used or the format of the data being sent.

Understanding how HTTP works helps us navigate the internet and troubleshoot any issues that may arise while browsing or accessing web pages.
